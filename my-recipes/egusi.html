    <h2>Steps to make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the Meat – In a medium-sized saucepan, boil the beef seasoned with salt (garlic salt), <br>
            smoked paprika, pepper, and onions until tender – make sure you add plenty of water, <br>
            so you have about 3-4 cups of beef stock for the soup. Remove the beef and reserve the stock.</li>
        <li>Saute Onions, Meat, and Crayfish – Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. <br>
            Add the onions and sauté until they are translucent, about 5 minutes. <br>
            Then add the beef, smoked turkey, and crayfish, and continue cooking.</li>
        <li>Add the Tomatoes – Stir in the tomatoes with their juices, garlic, <br>
            and 1-2 cups of beef stock. Bring to a boil and simmer for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now the Egusi – Add ground egusi and simmer on medium heat for approximately ten more minutes. <br>
            Then add beef stock as needed to get the desired consistency or prevent burning.</li> 
        <li>Add Spinach – Finally, throw in the spinach and let it simmer for 4-5 minutes. <br>
            Adjust seasonings to taste.</li>    
        <li>Serve warm with fried plantains, <br>
            fufu, yams, or your favorite starchy side dish.</li>              
    </ol>

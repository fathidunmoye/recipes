    <h2>Description</h2>
    Banga/Palm Nut Soup – A West African soup made from heavily pounding palm nut fruit to extract the pulp. <br>
    Then it’s simmered in assorted meat, spices, and bitter leaf or spinach. So rich and hearty!
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Palm Nuts</li>
        <li>Fish</li>
        <li>Bouillon</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps To Make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the Beef – Add meat, salt, garlic, smoked paprika, black pepper, and onion in a medium-sized saucepan, <br>
            and cook until tender, approximately 30-40 minutes. You can halve this process by using a pressure cooker or Instant Pot. <br>
            Reserve beef stock.</li>
        <li>Palm Nuts – Place palm nuts in a large pot. Add water to cover the palm nuts and boil until tender (about 1 hour). <br>
        </li>
        <li>Assemble – Add the reserved beef stock, cooked meat, smoked fish, crayfish, beef bouillon, and salt. <br>
            Bring to a boil and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes until it is nice and thick.</li>    
        <li>Add Vegetables – Throw in the chopped spinach, and adjust for soup consistency with water or stock. <br>
            Adjust for salt and pepper and simmer for 2 more minutes. </li>
        <li>Serve over rice or kwacoco.</li>        
    </ol>

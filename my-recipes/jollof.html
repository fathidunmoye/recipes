     <h2>Description</h2>
      Jollof rice, West Africa’s most popular dish.<br>
      I like to serve it as a side with my West African-style grilled beef (Suya),<br> 
      but it can also be a main course.
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul> 
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Fresh Tomato and Pepper</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Chicken stock</li>
        <li>Bay leaves</li>
        <li>Dry thyme</li>
      </ul>
        <h2>Steps To Make</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the base ingredients in a blender and blitz until <br> smooth.

        </li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven set over a medium heat.<br>
             Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes,<br>
              then add the tomato purée and cook, stirring frequently, until it begins to darken,<br>
             3 to 5 minutes.</li>
         <li>Pour in the blended base, stir to combine and bring to a simmer.<br>
             Reduce the heat to medium-low and partially cover the pot with the lid <br>
             it will splatter! Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is reduced by about a third of its original volume <br>
             and the oil begins to separate from the sauce, 12 to 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Stir in the curry powder, thyme, stock cubes, bay leaves and water. <br>
            Season generously with salt and pepper, to taste, then cover and bring to a boil <br>
            over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, rinse the rice thoroughly with cold water until the water runs clean, <br>
            then drain. Add the rice to the sauce and stir to combine. As soon as it comes to a boil, <br>
            reduce the heat to low, cover the pot and cook for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>By this point, the rice should have absorbed all the liquid and be cooked through. <br>
            Remove the bay leaves, give the rice a stir and you’re ready to serve, <br>
            preferably with grilled chicken and fried plantain.</li>    
      </ol>
